				<p class="bodyText">I interned at Facebook in the summer of 2020 where I got to be the lead designer in the early stages of a 0 – 1 project on Facebook Portal. However, I can’t show the work I did because it is confidential. What I can show, is a project I worked on independently that helped me land that Facebook internship. <br><br>
				Below is a project I completed as part of a summer bootcamp I created for myself in 2018, where I would finish design projects and visit tech hubs like NY, SF, and LA, to get feedback from industry professionals.</p>
